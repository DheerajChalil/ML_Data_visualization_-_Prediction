**Purpose**: Creates a clear binary target for machine learning

## 🌲 Why Use Random Forest (Not Other Algorithms)?

### 1. Handles Mixed Categorical Data

```python
features = ['cpt_code', 'insurance_company', 'physician_name']
```

* **RF is perfect** for:

  * CPT codes like '99213'
  * Insurers like 'Cigna'
  * Doctors like 'Dr. Smith'

* **No need for one-hot encoding or extensive preprocessing**

---

### 2. Feature Importance

```python
feature_importance = dict(zip(features, model.feature_importances_))
# Output: {'cpt_code': 0.65, 'insurance_company': 0.25, 'physician_name': 0.10}
```

**Business Value**:

* "CPT codes drive 65% of denial risk" → Focus training
* "Insurance companies = 25%" → Strengthen contracts
* "Providers = 10%" → Lower concern

---

### 3. Reduces Overfitting

```python
RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
```

* **100 Trees** = Ensemble voting
* **Prevents memorization** of training data
* **Stabilizes** predictions

---

### 4. Handles Imbalanced Data

* **Typical medical billing data**: 85% approved, 15% denied
* **RF strengths**:

  * Bootstrap sampling
  * Naturally works with minority class
  * No complex oversampling needed

## ⚠️ Why Not Other Algorithms?

| Algorithm           | Why Not                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Logistic Regression | ❌ Needs extensive encoding, linear assumptions, weak for imbalance |
| Neural Networks     | ❌ Overkill, black-box, needs tuning, less interpretability         |
| SVM                 | ❌ Poor with categoricals, slow, no feature importance              |
| Naive Bayes         | ❌ Assumes feature independence (not valid), weak with correlations |

## 🚀 Real-World Business Impact

**Without percentages (misleading)**:

> "CPT 99213 has 500 denials – biggest problem!"

**With percentages (insightful)**:

```
CPT 99213: 500 / 10,000 = 5% → Normal  
CPT 93000: 50 / 100 = 50% → Major red flag
```

**Random Forest Discovery**:

> Cigna + CPT 93000 + Dr. Patel = 85% denial probability
> Root Cause: Dr. Patel missed Cigna’s EKG pre-auth

**Action Plan**:

1. Train Dr. Patel on Cigna's rules
2. Renegotiate contract terms
3. Flag risky claims before submission
